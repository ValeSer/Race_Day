1. Race numbers are assigned randomly. Weâ€™ve provided the necessary code at the top of the file.    
    Check off this task after reading that line.
    You can read the hint if you want to learn how it works!
    HINT: Math.random() returns a value between 0 (inclusive) and 1 (exclusive).
        In order to make this set of numbers range from 0 (inclusive) to 1000 (exclusive) we can multiply the returned value by 1000.
        Finally, to ensure we only have whole numbers from 0 to 999 we can round down using Math.floor().
