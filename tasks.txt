1. Race numbers are assigned randomly. We’ve provided the necessary code at the top of the file.    
    Check off this task after reading that line.
    You can read the hint if you want to learn how it works!
    HINT: Math.random() returns a value between 0 (inclusive) and 1 (exclusive).
        In order to make this set of numbers range from 0 (inclusive) to 1000 (exclusive) we can multiply the returned value by 1000.
        Finally, to ensure we only have whole numbers from 0 to 999 we can round down using Math.floor().

2. Create a variable that indicates whether a runner registered early or not. 
    Set it equal to a Boolean value. You’ll change this later as you test different runner conditions.

3.Create a variable for the runner’s age and set it equal to a number.
    You’ll change this later as you test different runner conditions

4. Create a control flow statement that checks whether the runner is an adult AND registered early.
    Add 1000 to their raceNumber if this is true.
